What is HTML?

HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.



HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language


HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages

HTML elements are represented by tags

HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on

Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page    

A Simple HTML Document

Example Explained

The &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; declaration defines this document to be HTML5

The &lt;html&gt; element is the root element of an HTML page

The &lt;head&gt; element contains meta information about the document

The &lt;title&gt; element specifies a title for the document

The &lt;body&gt; element contains the visible page content

The &lt;!-- element defines a comment. This will not be rendered

The &lt;h1&gt; element defines a large heading

The &lt;p&gt; eement defines a paragraph


HTML Tags

HTML tags are element names surrounded by angle brackets:

&lt;tagname&gt;content goes here...&lt;/tagname&gt;

HTML tags normally come in pairs like &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt;
            
The first tag in a pair is the start tag, the second tag is the end tag
            
The end tag is written like the start tag, but with a forward slash inserted before the tag name
            
Tip:
The start tag is also called the opening tag, and the end tag the closing tag.
Browsers

The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them.

The browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document:
